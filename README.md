# SDS348_Project1
A project assigned in the class SDS 348 - Computational Biology and Bioinformatics


In this project, I analyzed two different data sets, Wage1 and Salaries. Both of these data sets can be found in this repository. From these data sets, I joined the data sets, tidy'd, wrangled and visualized data so that individuals can understand that correlations exist between an individual's salary, experience, and gender. Dimensionality reduction was also conducted, verified with silhouette checking. 

In this repository, you can find the two data sets (Salaries.csv and Wages1.csv) used for the analysis, a cleaned HTML file (Project1.html) that is easily navigatable, and a .Rmd file (Project1.Rmd) that shows the R code undergone to create and visualize the HTMl file.
